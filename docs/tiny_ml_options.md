# TinyML Options for Embedded Devices

## 1. Frameworks and Libraries

### TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLite Micro)
- Leading framework for TinyML
- Optimized for microcontrollers with limited memory (kilobytes) and processing power
- Workflow:
  1. Train model on a powerful computer using TensorFlow/Keras
  2. Convert to TFLite Micro format
  3. Generate C++ code for compilation on Arduino
- Features:
  - Pre-built kernels for common microcontroller operations
  - Strong Arduino integration with examples and libraries

### Edge Impulse
- Comprehensive platform simplifying the TinyML workflow
- Features:
  - Data collection from embedded devices
  - Cloud-based model design and training
  - Optimized firmware/Arduino library deployment
  - Automatic model optimization (quantization, pruning)
  - Strong Arduino Cloud integration

### Arm CMSIS-NN
- Optimized neural network kernels for Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers
- Works with TFLite Micro for enhanced performance
- Reduces memory requirements and speeds up inference

### MicroTensor
- Lightweight framework for AI on microcontrollers
- Focus on modularity and custom applications

## 2. Model Optimization Techniques

### Quantization
- Reduces model parameter precision (e.g., 32-bit float â†’ 8-bit int)
- Significantly reduces model size and computational needs
- Types:
  - Post-training quantization
  - Quantization-aware training

### Pruning
- Removes less important neural network connections/neurons
- Reduces model size and computational load
- Often followed by fine-tuning to recover accuracy

### Knowledge Distillation
- Trains a smaller "student" model to mimic a larger "teacher" model
- Compresses model while maintaining performance

## 3. Hardware Considerations for Arduino

### Recommended Boards
- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense/Rev2**
  - Cortex-M4 microcontroller
  - 256KB Flash, 32KB RAM
  - Onboard sensors (IMU, microphone, environmental)
  
- **Arduino Nicla Series**
  - More powerful options for complex applications
  - Includes vision capabilities (Nicla Vision)

- **ESP32-based Boards**
  - Arduino IDE compatible
  - Good balance of power and cost

## 4. General Workflow for TinyML on Arduino

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather sensor data from Arduino

2. **Model Training** (on computer)
   - Use TensorFlow/Keras
   - Apply TinyML optimizations
   - Train small ML models

3. **Model Conversion**
   - Convert to TFLite Micro format
   - Generates C++ header file

4. **Deployment**
   - Integrate model into Arduino sketch
   - Use TFLite Micro or Edge Impulse for inference
   - Upload to Arduino

5. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Test on-device performance
   - Fine-tune as needed
